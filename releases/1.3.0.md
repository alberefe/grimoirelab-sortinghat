## sortinghat 1.3.0 - (2024-08-30)

**New features:**

 * Remove merge recommendations (#883)\
   Recommendations can now be deleted from the database and not just
   dismissed. This is useful in case there are too many recommendations
   to handle manually.
 * Merge organizations when adding an alias (#913)\
   When adding an alias on an organization's page, if the new alias is an
   existing organization, users now have the option to merge them. This
   is useful in cases where organizations can't be merged using drag and
   drop.
 * User permissions per tenant\
   Update the permissions system to allow assigning permissions to users
   based on the tenant they are accessing. The command `sortinghat-admin
   set-group` has been renamed to `sortinghat.-admin set-permissions`.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Duplicated GitHub links (#912)\
   The link to an individual's GitHub profile no longer appears several
   times when there is more than one GitHub identity.
 * Connection closed when job is executed\
   RQ workers create a fork to run the jobs. The issue arises when, after
   completing the job, the MariaDB logs display the warning: `Aborted
   connection to db. Got an error reading communication packets`. This
   change ensures the database connection is closed before the fork ends,
   preventing the warning from appearing.
