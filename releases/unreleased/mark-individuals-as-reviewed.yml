  Individuals can now be marked as reviewed to keep track
  of which profiles have already been checked and when.
  A profile can be marked as reviewed more than once, it
  will show the date of the last review. If there have
  been any changes to the profile data since the last review,
  the review button displays a warning icon.

  The list of individuals can be filtered by whether they
  have been reviewed and by their review date. The list can
  also be ordered by review date.
