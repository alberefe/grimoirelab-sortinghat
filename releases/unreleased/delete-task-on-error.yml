title: Remove tasks that fail to be scheduled
category: fixed
author: Eva Millan <evamillan@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  When there was an issue with the Redis connection when
  a task was created, the task was added to the database
  but there was not scheduled job linked to it. Tasks are 
  now removed from the database and an error is raised in
  this case.
