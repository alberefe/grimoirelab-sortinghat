title: Groups table removed from the UI
category: removed
author: Eva Mill√°n <evamillan@bitergia.com>

notes: |
  Groups and organizations are very similar, and having both tables
  in the dashboard can be confusing to users.
  To simplify the view, the table is removed from the user interface,
  but groups remain available through the API.
