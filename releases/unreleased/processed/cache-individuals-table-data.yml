title: Cache individuals table data

notes: >
  Using cached queries prevents the table from
  refetching all the data from the server everytime
  any information is edited. This is particularly
  helpful if there is a huge number of identities,
  where reloading the table is very slow.
  However, there are some cases when the queries
  need to be refetched, eg. when identities are
  merged or split.
