title: CSRF token is only required on web requests

  The GraphQL API required the 'X-CSRFToken' header, but the
  token could only be retrieved by making a GET request.
  Now, requests authenticated using JWT don't need to provide the
  CSRF token and only the user interface, which is vulnerable
  to CSRF attacks and uses a different authentication, requires it.
