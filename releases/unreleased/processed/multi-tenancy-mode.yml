  SortingHat allows hosting multiple instances with a single service having each
  instance's data isolated in different databases.
  
  To enable this feature follow these guidelines:
  - Set `MULTI_TENANT` settings to `True`.
  - Define the tenants in `sortinghat/config/tenants.json`.
  - Assign users to tenants with `sortinghat-admin set-user-tenant` command.
