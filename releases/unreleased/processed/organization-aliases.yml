notes: >
  Organizations can be known by different names. To avoid
  duplicates, organizations can have aliases.
  Searching for an organization using one of its aliases returns
  the organization.
  When an organization is merged into another, its name becomes
  an alias of the target organization.
  If a name exists as an alias, no organization can be created
  with that name and viceversa.
  An organization's aliases can be added and deleted both on the
  organizations table and the single organization view.
