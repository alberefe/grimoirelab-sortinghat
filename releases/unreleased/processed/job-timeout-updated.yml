title: Job timeouts
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: |
  Jobs failed because they exceeded the default timeout while running
  tasks involving numerous identities. To ensure successful completion,
  we adjusted the timeout setting to an infinite duration, allowing jobs to
  finish without interruptions.
