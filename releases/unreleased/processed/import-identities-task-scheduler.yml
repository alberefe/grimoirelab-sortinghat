title: Use the task scheduler to import identities
category: deprecated
author: Eva Mill√°n <evamillan@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: |
  Manage periodic tasks to import identities with the `scheduleTask`,
  `updateScheduledTask` and `deleteScheduledTask` GraphQL mutations.
  The tasks that were already scheduled using the `addImportIdentitiesTask`
  mutation are kept when the migrations are applied.
