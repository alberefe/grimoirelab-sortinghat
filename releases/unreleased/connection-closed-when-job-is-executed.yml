title: Connection closed when job is executed
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  RQ workers create a fork to run the jobs. The issue arises
  when, after completing the job, the MariaDB logs display the
  warning: `Aborted connection to db. Got an error reading
  communication packets`. This change ensures the database
  connection is closed before the fork ends, preventing the
  warning from appearing.
