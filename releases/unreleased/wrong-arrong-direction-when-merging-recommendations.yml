title: Wrong arrong direction when merging recommendations
category: fixed
author: Andre Klapper
issue: 934
notes: >
  When recommendations were merged, the arrow showing the
  direction of the merge was wrong. It showed `foo â†’ bar`
  but the resulting identity will be named `foo` instead
  of `bar`. The arrow now points in the other direction
  showing that `bar` will be merged on `foo`.
