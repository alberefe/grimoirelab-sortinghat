title: Import identities automatically

notes: |
  Create a schema to import identities to SortingHat automatically
  using custom backends. The jobs will be executed periodically, at
  the given interval.

  The tasks can be configured using the GraphQL API.

  To create a custom importer you need to extend `IdentitiesImporter`,
  define a `NAME` for your importer (that will be used in the UI), and
  implement `get_identities` method that returns a list of individuals
  with the related identities that will be imported into SortingHat.
  If your importer requires extra parameters, you must extend the `__init__`
  method with the required parameters. Those parameters can be defined
  using the API.
