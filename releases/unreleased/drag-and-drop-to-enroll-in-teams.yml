notes: |
  Expanding an organization on the table now shows the
  full list of teams. Individuals can be dragged and
  dropped into a team and viceversa to affiliate them.
  The buttons to add, edit and delete organization and
  team information are reorganized into a dropdown menu
  to simplify the interface.
