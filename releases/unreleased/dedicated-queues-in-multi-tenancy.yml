title: Dedicated queues in multi-tenancy
category: added
author: Santiago Due√±as <sduenas@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  This new feature allows to run jobs in dedicated
  queues when multi-tenancy is active. Therefore,
  tenants that require more computing time,
  can run in a separate environment without taking
  the resources of others.
  This new feature changes the format of the
  `tenants.json` file, so please update it before
  you install this new version. You can find more
  info about how to configure it in the
  `README.md` file.
