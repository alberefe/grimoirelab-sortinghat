## sortinghat 0.15.0 - (2023-11-03)

**New features:**

 * Recommendations for individuals modified after a given date (#813)\
   Users can generate merge and affiliation recommendations for
   individuals that have been created or modified after a date specified
   with the `last_modified` parameter.
 * Add individual to workspace from their profile page (#816)\
   A new button on the individual's profile page allows users to save the
   identity in the workspace to continue working with it later on the
   dashboard.
 * Cache individuals table data (#821)\
   Using cached queries prevents the table from refetching all the data
   from the server everytime any information is edited. This is
   particularly helpful if there is a huge number of identities, where
   reloading the table is very slow. However, there are some cases when
   the queries need to be refetched, eg. when identities are merged or
   split.
