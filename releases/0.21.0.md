## sortinghat 0.21.0 - (2024-03-01)

**New features:**

 * Dedicated queues in multi-tenancy\
   This new feature allows to run jobs in dedicated queues when multi-
   tenancy is active. Therefore, tenants that require more computing
   time, can run in a separate environment without taking the resources
   of others. This new feature changes the format of the `tenants.json`
   file, so please update it before you install this new version. You can
   find more info about how to configure it in the `README.md` file.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Match recommendations job fixed\
   Fix the bug in recommend matches jobs that was causing it not to
   recommend any matches.

**Dependencies updateds:**

 * Drop support of Node.js <18\
   Versions 14 to 16 of Node.js are no longer mantained. The current
   supported versions are 18 to 20.
