## sortinghat 0.20.0-rc.1 - (2024-02-19)

**New features:**

 * Organization aliases (#857)\
   Organizations can be known by different names. To avoid duplicates,
   organizations can have aliases. Searching for an organization using
   one of its aliases returns the organization. When an organization is
   merged into another, its name becomes an alias of the target
   organization. If a name exists as an alias, no organization can be
   created with that name and viceversa. An organization's aliases can be
   added and deleted both on the organizations table and the single
   organization view.
