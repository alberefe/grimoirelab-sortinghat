## sortinghat 0.13.0 - (2023-08-06)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Sub-domain affiliation error (#805)\
   The `affiliate` and `recommend affiliations` jobs no longer recommend
   matches based on a domain's sub-domains if it is not marked as
   `top_domain`.

**New deprecations:**

 * Use the task scheduler to import identities\
   Manage periodic tasks to import identities with the `scheduleTask`,
   `updateScheduledTask` and `deleteScheduledTask` GraphQL mutations. The
   tasks that were already scheduled using the `addImportIdentitiesTask`
   mutation are kept when the migrations are applied.
