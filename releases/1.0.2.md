## sortinghat 1.0.2 - (2024-06-21)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Match source parameter fixed in recommendations (#875)\
   Resolve an issue where the "match source" option in unify and
   recommendation jobs was being applied to both emails and names. With
   this update, this option will now only apply to usernames.
   Additionally, users can utilize name and email simultaneously without
   the constraint of applying the "match source" option across all
   parameters.
 * Organizations aliases in Python client\
   Include the aliases field in the organizations query that was missing
   in the SortingHat client schema.
